The improvement of well known Crossing Number (cn) algorithm for determining the inclusion of a point P in a 2D planar polygon. 

This implementation (i.e. function - is_inside_sm() ) is tested against standard Crossing Number (cn) algorithm and Winding Number (wn) algorithm.

Unlike standard implementations (cn and wn), this one WORKS ON EDGES, providing (at least) equally good execution speed. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sasamil/WMS-TMS-Maker-Qt-GUI/master/icons/emoticons/running-smiley.gif" alt="fast, faster..." height="21" width="30">
